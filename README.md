# File description
Grad_Maze: Codes used to train the model;

w/ these codes above, u're already able to train another model and test the vehicle.            

/////////////////////////////////////////////////    
Make_Grid_Map: Codes used to transform raw data into grid map(strongly recommanded)   
Models_Backup: Another copy of model, just in case :)   

P.S. Change the serial port id and name like "/dev/ttyUSB0" or "COM8" if necessary.
